## About

![Image](/images/photos/profile.jpeg){:height=600px" width="360px" style="float:right; padding:10px"}

Security Researcher based in São Paulo with background in Software Engineering and 5 years of experience in the offensive security industry. Research focus of Gouvêa is vulnerability discovery in applications/services and exploit development - I have fun bypassing modern defenses, exploring systems and playing with new technologies and in parallel: sharing some of my research notes on [my blog](/);

Security Advisories: [CVE-2019-15032](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15032), [CVE-2019-15033](/2019/09/17/CVE-2019-15033), [CVE-2020-9376](/2020/03/04/CVE-2020-9376), [CVE-2020-9377](/2020/03/04/CVE-2020-9377);

I am always on the lookout for new research areas particularly in vulnerability hunting (news bugs classes or vulnerabilities in relevants applications/services) and building security tools. If you have a research proposal and would be interested in inviting me to collaborate, do not hesitate to get in touch via email. I am especially interested in collaborating with private companies in the field of enginneering security tooling. If you want to contact me, here is my email: [hi@heitorgouvea.me](mailto:hi@heitorgouvea.me)

Please note: I have a priority queue of research proposals and therefore may not be able to respond to every collaboration request.

In addition, I welcome bug bounty and live-hacking event invites. I usually go by “htrgouvea” on most popular bug bounty platforms.
