## Technical Mentorship

In the last years, I have led Offensive Security, AppSec Operation and Engineering teams. I mentored more than 100 engineers and security analysts, contributed to their performance, career and studies plans. Consequently learned a lot during this journey.

So, I offer coaching sessions focused on technical roles, and how to get there and perform beyond expectations.

### What topics have you covered in the past?

I have covered a vast breadth of various topics that accelerated each person's own journey. Some example scenarios include:

- Building and follow-up Individual Development Plan (where to invest for the most impact on personal growth);
- The best approaches to successfully building high-performing (security) teams;
- Influencing non-technical stakeholders;
- Discussing trade-offs in making complex and wide-reaching decisions;

### What is included?

All prep & follow up work before and after each session (usually 30-45 mins of the coach's time before and after each session).

- New access to an exclusive Telegram group;
- Unlimited support (email and text messages apps like WhatsApp/Telegram) in-between sessions;
- Access to a dedicated coaching portal (on Notion);
- Access to a curated list of resources to support you on your journey;
- Relevant introductions to Heitor connections and network, as required;
- CV and interview support, as required;

Each session lasts an average of 1 hour and happens on a monthly basis.
